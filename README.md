## Solutions for Compatibility Between Node.js and Browser Environments

There are two primary ways to handle compatibility between a Node.js package (e.g., `lz-utilities`) and a browser environment (e.g., a Next.js app). These solutions can be applied either on the **producer side** (in the package itself) or the **consumer side** (in the Next.js app). However, resolving this issue on the producer side is generally the preferred approach.

---

### **Producer Side Solutions**

1. **Conditional Imports or Dynamic Loading of `fs`**  
   Use conditional imports or dynamic loading to ensure that `fs` is only imported in a Node.js environment. For example, load `fs` only when the code is executed server-side:

   ```typescript
   if (typeof window === "undefined") {
     const fs = await import("fs");
   }
   ```

2. **Split `fs`-Related Functions into a Separate Package**  
   Separate `fs`-dependent code into a different package so that it can be conditionally imported in a browser-compatible manner. The core package would remain browser-friendly, and the package that relies on `fs` could be used exclusively in server-side environments.

3. **Use the `"exports"` Field to Define Browser-Specific Entry Points**  
   Leverage the `exports` field in `package.json` to define a separate entry point for the browser environment. This allows the package to specify which code to run in different environments:

   ```json
   {
     "exports": {
       "import": "./dist/index.mjs",
       "require": "./dist/index.cjs.js",
       "browser": "./dist/index.browser.js"
     }
   }
   ```

   You would also need to modify the build tool (e.g., `tsup`) to compile the package for both Node.js and browser environments.

4. **Use the `"browser"` Field in `package.json` to Mock or Remove `fs`**  
   In your `package.json`, add a `"browser"` field to replace the `fs` module with a mock or `false` to indicate it should be excluded in the browser:

   ```json
   {
     "browser": {
       "fs": false
     }
   }
   ```

   This method is supported by bundlers such as Webpack and Rollup, ensuring that `fs` is excluded from the browser build.

### **Consumer Side Solutions**

1. **Set `fs` to `false` in `webpack.config.js` (for Next.js App)**  
   In the `next.config.js` file, configure Webpack to resolve `fs` as `false`, effectively preventing bundlers from attempting to include it in the browser build:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     webpack(config) {
       config.resolve.fallback = {
         fs: false,
       };
       return config;
     },
   };
   ```

2. **Use `webpack-node-externals` to Exclude `fs`**  
   You can also use `webpack-node-externals` in the Webpack configuration to explicitly exclude `fs` (and other Node.js built-ins) from being bundled into the client-side application.

---

### **Preferred Approach**

The most optimal solution would be to handle this issue on the **producer side** by using the **`browser` field in `package.json`** and defining the appropriate entry points for the browser environment. This approach allows you to tailor the packageâ€™s behavior for both Node.js and browser environments, and it avoids additional configuration on the consumer side.

## Examples

any of these solutions can resolve the compatibility issue between Node.js and browser environments.

### **Use the `"browser"` Field in `package.json` to Mock or Remove `fs`**

the [@example/utils](./packages/utils/package.json) package

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "fs": false
  }
}
```

### **Set `fs` to `false` in `webpack.config.js` (for Next.js App)**

the [@example/next-app](./packages/next-app/next.config.js) package

```typescript
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  /* config options here */
  webpack: (config) => {
    config.resolve.fallback = {
      fs: false,
    };
    return config;
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```

### **Set `resolve.alias` to module in `vite.config.ts` (for Vite App)**
```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import { nodePolyfills } from 'vite-plugin-node-polyfills'
import * as path from 'path'

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), nodePolyfills({
    exclude: ['module'], // Exclude the unwanted modules
  })],

  resolve: {
    alias: {
      module: path.resolve(__dirname, './src/polyfills/module.js'), // Alias 'module' to an empty module
    },
  },
})
```
and the `src/polyfills/module.js` contains:
```typescript
export function createRequire() {
    console.warn(`createRequire is not supported in the browser environment.`);
    return function (path) {
      console.warn(`Attempted to use require() in the browser. Path: ${path}`);
      return {};
    };
  }
```

## Troubleshooting
When using pnp mode or pnpm mode, it may report an error like this:
```shell
error TS2307: Cannot find module 'fs' or its corresponding type declarations.
```
Setting `nodeLinker` to `node-modules` in the [.yarnrc.yml](./.yarnrc.yml) file can solve this problem.
